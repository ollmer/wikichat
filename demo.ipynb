      "[Wikipedia-based answer] The LIGO project works by using a large-scale physics experiment called Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). This observatory is designed to detect cosmic gravitational waves and develop them as an astronomical tool. It consists of two large observatories built in the United States, with mirrors spaced four kilometers apart that can detect changes less than one ten-thousandth the charge diameter of a proton. The LIGO project was designed by scientists from California Institute of Technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and industrial contractors, and funded by the National Science Foundation. It aims to open the field of gravitational-wave astronomy through the detection of gravitational waves predicted by general relativity.\n",

It was designed to open the field of gravitational-wave astronomy through the detection of gravitational waves predicted by general relativity. Gravitational waves were detected for the first time by the LIGO detector in 2015. For contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves, two Caltech physicists, Kip Thorne and Barry Barish, and MIT physicist Rainer Weiss won the Nobel Prize in physics in 2017. Weiss, who is also an MIT graduate, designed the laser interferometric technique, which served as the essential blueprint for the LIGO. \n",

A currently ongoing upgrade to Advanced LIGO will require several kilowatts of laser power, and scientists will need to contend with thermal distortion, frequency variation of the lasers, mirror displacement and thermally induced birefringence. \n",
